## Installation :zap:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```sh
npm install gei-bookings
```

## Usage üèóÔ∏è

##### We will be using graphql-editor-cli to speed-up the usage process, </br> You can install it with:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```sh
npm install -g graphql-editor-cli
```

First, you can check out our [gei-bookings sandbox schema](https://app.graphqleditor.com/editor-integrations/bookings-sandbox) or create your own schema, but be sure to connect gei-bookings to your resolvers in microservices.

create your .graphql-editor.json file in the root dir of project:

```json
{
  "namespace": "editor-integrations",
  "project": "bookings-sandbox",
  "projectVersion": "latest",
  "typingsEnv": "node",
  "typingsHost": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "typingsDir": "./src",
  "backendSrc": "./src",
  "backendLib": "./lib",
  "schemaDir": "./"
}
```

And run the follwing command in the project:

```sh
gecli schema && gecli cloud install
```

Now everything should work! Have fun using :smile:
